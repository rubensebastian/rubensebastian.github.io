            <h2>Media Suite Report</h2>
            <p>The Media Suite is a self-service recording and editing studio created to support the video and audio
                needs of students at Florida State University. Opened at the beginning of 2023, the space has performed
                even better than anticipated. I documented its background and usage in my <a

                    Report</a>, including charts next steps.</p>

            <h2>Automatic Speech Recognition Research Report</h2>
            <p>FSU&apos;s online research repository has a wealth of video and audio content, but most of it is
                uncaptioned.
                This presents a problem for any deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) researchers who need to access the content
                in the repository. Our research team set out to answer the question: can Automatic Speech Recognition
                (ASR) software be used to simplify the captioning workflow. <a

                    target="_blank">Our
                    initial findings showed promising results for the software tested (pdf opens in new tab)</a>; we are
                currently testing the
                amount of time saved by editing <em>nearly</em> accurate captions compared to generating captions from
                scratch.</p>

            <h2>Media Suite User Guide (Articulate 360)</h2>
            <p>The creation of the Media Suite @ Dirac was a large-scale project I led in Fall 2022 and early Spring
                2023. To go along with this space, I created an <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

                system (LMS) optimized for mobile viewing or integrating with another LMS like Canvas. The guide covers
                use of the studio space and its equipment, along with links for tutorials that may change (such as
                Creative Cloud software).</p>
