            <h3>Chatbot Proposal</h3>
            <p>
                In March of 2024, I came up with the idea of a chatbot that could answer questions about our books
                without giving away the proprietary content. Before I knew anything about vector embeddings and prompt
                engineering, this was my first proposal: <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

            <h2>Media Suite</h2>
            <h3>Report on Usage</h3>
            <p>The Media Suite is a self-service recording and editing studio created to support the video and audio
                needs of students at Florida State University. Opened at the beginning of 2023, the space performed
                even better than anticipated. I documented its background and usage in my <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
                    href="/files/Media Suite Report.pdf" target="_blank">Media Suite Report (pdf opens in new tab)</a>,
                including charting next steps.</p>

            <h3>User Guide</h3>
            <p>The creation of the Media Suite @ Dirac was a large-scale project I led in Fall 2022 and early Spring
                2023. To go along with this space, I created an <a
                    href="https://rise.articulate.com/share/w9wK3CYLAAUgMJ6yCQxy3CjiUsj-prJk">instructional guide</a>
                with Rise 360, a learning management
                system (LMS) optimized for mobile viewing or integrating with another LMS like Canvas. The guide covers
                use of the studio space and its equipment, along with links for tutorials that may change (such as
                Creative Cloud software).

            <h2>Automatic Speech Recognition Research Report</h2>
            <p>FSU's online research repository has a wealth of video and audio content, but most of it is
                uncaptioned.
                This presents a problem for any deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) researchers who need to access the content
                in the repository. Our research team set out to answer the question: can Automatic Speech Recognition
                (ASR) software be used to simplify the captioning workflow. <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

            <h2>Instructional Video Production</h2>
            <p>I created short instructional videos on library services. You can view them through the <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/fsulibraries">FSU Libraries' YouTube</a> page. Videos included <a
