            <h1>About Ruben</h1>
            <p>I am a Web Developer at Johns Hopkins University Press, working primarily with Drupal and React
                (Typescript). You can find below, in order: my philosophy in the creation of this site, a broad outline
                of my current work, my hobby projects, and a little about me at the end.
            </p>

            <h2>About this Site</h2>
            <p>As a Technical Support Specialist turned Digital Accessibility Specialist turned Web Developer, I have
                honed my technical and troublshooting skills. But I do not only have technical competence; I can also
                communicate goals to leadership, recieve feedback from stakeholders, and train nontechnical staff. I
                have arranged my portfolio to include specific examples of these two broad categories I excel at.
            </p>
            <p>I have chosen to keep the CSS on this portfolio minimal: you are here to find information about me, not
                to be amazed by a sparkling cursor, impressive bezier curves, or text that slides onto the screen after
                a delay. If you are interested in seeing examples of my CSS comptence, please refer to <a
                    href="/development">examples in the Development section</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <h3>Drupal Development</h3>
            <p>My work primarily focuses on front-end Drupal development: custom module development, troubleshooting
                bugs, and continuous evaluation for quality improvement and accessibility. My work also includes server
                configuation (Linux/Apache), certs, and basic maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>One major project is the creation of a Drupal Multisite to <em>drastically</em> reduce development time
                spent on client association sites. Using this structure, we can build one set of templates for (Drupal)
                paragraphs, blocks, and views. Those templates are then available to be used in any association site. In
                order to allow customization on a per-association basis, I built the "Brand Styles" custom module to
                allow Hopkins Press personnel to configure styles for each site in a safe, reliable way.
            </p>

            <h3>React & TypeScript</h3>
            <p>
                My introduction to coding was through vanilla JavaScript, and it will always hold a place in my heart. I
                have found, however, that TypeScript makes for a much more reliable developer experience. Reading
                other's code (and your own) becomes <em>so</em> much easier. I still use JavaScript for some Drupal work
                or for random little projects, but overall I prefer TypeScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite its quirks, I enjoy React. I have chosen to delve deeper into learning React rather than
                spreading my knowledge across other frameworks like Angular or Vue. I also enjoy using the
                meta-framework Next.js (but still TypeScript)—this is what I've used for <a
                    href="https://math-fun.org">Math Fun</a> as well as the <a
                    href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/53869/teaching-ai/">Hopkins Press Books Chatbot</a>
                (example of one of the pages where the chatbot appears).
            </p>

            <h2>Hobby</h2>
            <p>I enjoy working on web projects in my free time as well. I tend to use React (or React Native) for these
                projects, such as <a href="https://jobnote.app">JobNote</a> (web) or <a
                    href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortunai/id6744840710">FortunAI</a> (mobile
                app). I manage the servers and daemon processes to upkeep them; while I design the PostgreSQL databases
                for these projects, I use a managed database to leave me more time for frontend work.
            </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I like to hike, read, and search for new bubble tea spots.</p>
