        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am currently a Web Developer at Johns Hopkins University Press, working primarily with Drupal and React
            (Typescript). You can find below, in order, my philosophy in the creation of this site, a broad outline of
            my current work, my hobby projects, and a little about me at the end.</p>

        <h2>About this Site</h2>
        <p>As a Technical Support Specialist turned Digital Accessibility Specialist turned Web Developer, I have honed
            my technical and troublshooting skills. But I do not only have technical competence; I can also communicate
            goals to leadership, recieve feedback from stakeholders, and train nontechnical staff. I have arranged my
            portfolio to include specific examples of these two broad categories I excel at.</p>
        <p>I have chosen to keep the CSS on this portfolio minimal: you are here to find information about me, not to be
            amazed by a sparkling cursor, impressive bezier curves, or text that slides onto the screen after a delay.
            If you are interested in seeing examples of my CSS comptence, please refer to <a
                href="/development">examples in the Development section</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Drupal Development</h2>
        <p>My work primarily focuses on front-end Drupal development: custom module development, troubleshooting bugs,
            and continuous evaluation for quality improvement and accessibility. My work also includes server
            configuation (Linux/Apache), certs, and basic maintenance.</p>
        <p>One major project is the creation of a Drupal Multisite to <em>drastically</em> reduce development time spent
            on client association sites. Using this structure, we can build one set of templates for (Drupal)
            paragraphs, blocks, and views. Those templates are then available to be used in any association site. In
            order to allow customization on a per-association basis, I built the "Brand Styles" custom module to allow
            Hopkins Press personnel to configure styles for each site in a safe, reliable way.</p>
