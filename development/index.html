            <h2>Video Format Conversion Automation</h2>
            <p>FSU was maintaining a collection of over 800 videos developed from 2007-2015 through the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoset">GEOSET initative</a>. These videos could only run
                through
                the outdated Mediasite player and cost the university more than $10,000 per month. To preserve these
                records, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/rubensebastian/videoDownload">collection of python
                    scripts</a> to download the collection of files, convert the slides (images) into video based on
                timings pulled from xml, and overlay the slides with a speaker video if necessary. The project used a
                Selenium bot and a number of video manipulation libraries for python.</p>

            <h2>eTextbook Retrieval Automation</h2>
            <p>This project serves to automate a number of process associated with FSU Librariesâ€™ eTextbook program.
                Previously,
                the Libraries used part-time staff to manually compile thousands of entries. I drastically reduced time
                spent on
                this project by automating calls to an API, compiling results in the needed CSV files, and running a bot
                with
                Selenium to check access models (which were generated separately from the API). <a

            <h2>Math Fun</h2>
            <p>I began developing <a href="https://math-fun.org">Math Fun</a> as a digitization of Math Fun Day with the
                FSU Math Department. The collaboration eventually fell through, but I am continuing to build out
                components for the website. The purely front-end project is built on React.js, and it uses p5.js for
                visualization of some of the components. <a href="https://github.com/rubensebastian/math-fun-1">Math Fun
