            <h2 id="chatbot">Retrieval Augmented Chatbot</h2>
            <p>
                Hopkins Press contains thousands of proprietary books. This book content cannot be accessed by customers
                until they have already purchased the book. We are testing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
                Chatbot on a set of our book pages. The chatbot allows users to "interrogate" the book contents with
                their research questions <em>without</em> sharing the book content itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chatbot itself is a React app using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai">AI SDK</a> to
                stream the chat responses to the frontend. The pages are built by Next.js according to their BookID;
                Next.js also handles the abstraction of the server-side functions, which connect to the OpenAI API and
                to our database. The database contains the contents of each book in individuals paragraphs—as well as
                the vector embeddings of each paragraph. When a user asks a question, the following happens:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The question is converted into a vector embedding.</li>
                <li>The vector embedding is compared against the book content embeddings to find the most relevant
                    content.</li>
                <li>The user question and book contents are passed to the OpenAI's Chat Completion AI along with
                    instructions on how to respond to the user.</li>
                <li>The answer is streamed to the user.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Association Multisite</h2>
            <p>
                Hopkins Press works extensively with academic associations to produce their journals—as part of this we
                also maintain websites for them. Previously, the method was to "copy and paste" one association site to
                create another. This created two problems: bug fixes would not be reflected across all the sites and
                updating Drupal versions required updating each site individually.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the associations re-used much of the same functionality, we transitioned to using a Drupal
                multisite to streamline the development process. I built out the templates, coded custom modules in PHP,
                and wrote out the CSS that would apply to all the sites, keeping accessibility and usability front and
                center. Maintain the server (Linux) and Apache configuration, keeping things up to date according to the
                quarterly security audits. As a result of adopting this multsite structure, <strong>time spent creating
                    a new site is under 30 minutes and Drupal updates only need to be completed once for the entirety of
                    the sites</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Video Format Conversion Automation</h2>
            <p>FSU was maintaining a collection of over 800 videos developed from 2007-2015 through the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoset">GEOSET initative</a>. These videos could only run
                through the outdated Mediasite player and cost the university more than $10,000 per month. To
                preserve
                these records, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/rubensebastian/videoDownload">collection of
                    python
                    scripts</a> to download the collection of files, convert the slides (images) into video based on
                timings pulled from xml, and overlay the slides with a speaker video if necessary. The project used
                a
                Selenium bot and a number of video manipulation libraries for python.
            </p>

            <h2>eTextbook Retrieval Automation</h2>
            <p>This project serves to automate a number of process associated with FSU Libraries’ eTextbook program.
                Previously,
                the Libraries used part-time staff to manually compile thousands of entries. I drastically reduced
                time
                spent on
                this project by automating calls to an API, compiling results in the needed CSV files, and running a
                bot
                with
                Selenium to check access models (which were generated separately from the API). <a

            </p>

            <h2>Math Fun</h2>
            <p>I began developing <a href="https://math-fun.org">Math Fun</a> as a digitization of Math Fun Day with
                the
                FSU Math Department. After the event, I have continued to maintain and add to the project. The
                purely
                front-end project is built on React.js, and it uses p5.js for visualization of some of the
                components.
