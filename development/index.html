            while allowing for customizations on a per-site basis. I handle

            I created a simple, lightweight portfolio site for a friend,
            <a href="https://jess-tran.com">Jess Tran</a>. Because it was
            important for the site to look slick, but also for her to be able to
            make edits to her content (without any knowledge of html/git), I
            used
            <strong
              >Next for the frontend and integrated Payload CMS for the
              backend</strong
            >.

          <p>
            This site reflects my values on accessibility. The HTML uses
            <strong>semantic elements and proper structure</strong>. Colors were
            chosen to
            <strong
              >look good while accounting for users with low vision or color
              blindness</strong
            >. Images are not used to convey information; they are purely
            decorative. Font and font size were chosen to
            <strong
              >ensure legibility for users anywhere on the disability
              spectrum</strong
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I incorporate responsive design into any CSS I write:
            <strong
              >relative measurements, flex box design, image srcsets</strong
            >, etc. Moreover, I test rigorously: a design may work in principle
            but fail in practice; it is therefore vital to test it on many
            viewports before moving to a production server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CSS frameworks I work the most with are
            <strong>Tailwind and SASS</strong>. I appreciate Tailwind for its
            lightweight, straightforward patterns, and I use it mainly with Node
            projects. I appreciate SASS for its modularity and syntax, and I use
            it primarily for Drupal projects.

        <section aria-labelledby="Express">
          <h2 id="Express">Express</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy writing servers with Express, as it offers a lighweight,
            easy-to-use Node environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used Express for the backend of my mobile app,
            <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortunai/id6744840710"
              >FortunAI</a
            >
            (private repository). To bring the server for the mobile app to
            life, I used
            <strong
              >node packages including aws-sdk, OpenAI, Resend, and
              Prisma</strong
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I handled user management for
            <a href="https://jobnote.app">JobNote</a> with Next's built-in
            server routes, I needed more power for the actual functionality. The
            Express backend includes node packages like
            <strong>huggingface/transformers, zod, OpenAI, and Prisma</strong>.

          <p>PLACEHOLDER FOR VECTOR EMBEDDINGS SCRIPT</p>
          <p>
            To convert about 800
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoset">GEOSET</a> videos
            from an outdated file format to mp4, I wrote a

              >collection of Python scripts</a
            >
            that downloaded the collection of files, converted the slides
            (images) into video based on timings pulled from xml, and overlaid
            the slides with a speaker video if necessary. This used a
            <strong

            For work projects, we run
            <strong>Apache on Red Hat Enterprise Linux machines</strong>. These
            <strong>server configurations pass rigorous security audits</strong
            >, and I consistently make tweaks to remedy any issues disocvered in
            these audits.

            For personal projects, I typically use
            <strong>nginx on linux servers</strong>
            (DigitalOcean Droplets). I use

          </p>
          <p>
            For personal projects, I use <strong>GitHub</strong>. I use this
            mainly as backup and to keep production servers up to date with the
